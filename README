This is a sample multithreaded emedded python application.

This is a tutorial for how to embed python correctly inside a multi 
threaded program. Python is a very neat language which is very easy to 
embed inside C++ thanks to the boost::python library. But there are some 
crucial parts which is missing from boost:python in regards to how to 
manage GIL and thread state which I introduce here. Since this is my 
first C++ tutorial I will include boost:thread as well as a quick hello 
world application as well.
